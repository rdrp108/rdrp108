The files in this branch are related to my Kotlin app which stored food names, photos, and expiration dates in a database and displayed the parameters for the item the user selected in the android app GUI. Users could edit the parameters from the app and the database would store the updated information.
I recommend either watching the mp4 video or reading my Reference pdf to get an idea of how the application functions.
